Company: Atomic Fish Hatchery, Inc.
Project: Field Sales Ordering and Commission Application

Scope: This application will be accessible from multiple devices (mobile and PC) to allow field sales agents, managers,
and payroll personnel easy access to necessary information. The system will accept information from the sales agent that
will be used to determine purchase costs to the customer, sales volume for the sales manager, and commissions for the
payroll department. Phase one of the project is the development of the application to accept information from the sales agents,
display purchase cost, determination of commissions, and storage of the information into a MySQL database.
After successful testing the platform, it will be moved and secured in the company’s cloud platform.

Inputs (from Sales Agent): Sales Agent Number, Customer Number, Order Number, Item Number, Quantity, and Special Needs

Outputs: (Additional information may be determined for future phases)

To database: In addition to the input from the sales agent: commission, sales total

The goal is to determine the types of information and processes that will occur in
each tier and the data flow between the tiers. Once determined, this information could be used
to develop a general empty structure of tiers that would eventually hold the completed project.

        
        INTERFACE TIER
    -----------------------
ATFI Sales & Order Application Interface
    - Platform: Microsoft Windows
    - Versions: Mobile, Web, PC

* Inputs/Outputs (dataset):
    - Sales Agent Number(* Char Numberic)
    - Customer Number (8 Char Numberic)
    - +Order Number (6 Char Numberic)
    - +Item Number (6 Char Numberic)
    - +Quantity (6 Char Numberic)
    - +Special Needs (40 Char Alphanumeric)

* Methods:
    - Verification of all Inputs
    - Conversion of Quantity to integer format
    - Creation of Dataset/Datatable and transfer to BR

        BUSINESS RULES TIER
    -----------------------------
    Language: PHP
*Inputs: Dataset (define by Interface Tier)
* Outputs: (data within input fields)
* Commission (6 chars floating point)
* Total Sales (8 chars floating point)

* Process 1:
    - accept the complete order (dataset/data table)
    - determine the total sales cost after the sales agent clicked a “competed order” button.
    - return a summary of this information to the second form
* Process 2:
    - execute when the agent clicks an “approved” button
    - determine the commission and create a dataset (there are now additional fields) to be passed to the data tier
    - Information would then be passed for storage.

* Methods:
    - Validate or verification of fields received from IT to ensure data validity;
    - Calculation of commission and Sales total
    - Creation of Dataset/Datatable
    - Transfer of Dataset to Interface Tier for Approval
    - Transfer of Approved Dataset to Data Tier
    - Check security of all data traferred between tiers before being processed


        DATA TIER
    -------------------
Used to store the information provided by the business rules tier.
The tier would verify the information received and store it into the database

    Language: MySQL/MariaDB

* Inputs: Data (defined by BR Tier)
* Outputs: SQL Insert of Dataset fields

* Methods:
    - Verification of input dataset
    - Creation and execution of SQL Insert for Dataset fields
