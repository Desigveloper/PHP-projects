Term Project: 
Your supervisor has requested that you design a secure application that will keep track of
inventory in the warehouse of the ABC Computer Parts Corporation. This application will be
accessible both within the warehouse itself and outside (via the Internet and/or smart phones).

What data fields are necessary to keep track of this information?
What size and data types (string, integer, floating point) should define these fields?
What other restrictions on input (no negative values for item number) should be defined for these fields?

For example, if a Social Security Number (SSN) was a required field:
SSN: SIZE: Min: 9 characters (string) Max: 9 characters (string) Restrictions: Valid SSN format
Notice that it uses characters, not integers, because no calculations will be done on the SSN number.

Using the information, you have determined:
    -Develop a logical design of the ABC Computer Parts Inventory application.
    - This design should include all possible programs, interfaces, and data storage.
    -The application design must be three-tier (interface, business rules, and data).
    -Your final design should look similar to the examples shown in this chapter.
